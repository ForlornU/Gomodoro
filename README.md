# WorkTimer

This is a timer that is supposed to help with productivity.
Start working with this timer set and after 30 minutes or whatever time you set, it will let you know its time for a break.
The app will switch between work-mode and break-mode back and forth, letting you balance your work and spare-time.

This is recomended for people working from home, not at your job!
