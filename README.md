# WorkTimer

This is a timer that is supposed to help with productivity.
Start working with this timer set and after 25 minutes or whatever time you set, it will let you know its time for a break.
After a 5 minute break it will let you know when its time to work again, playing a short sound.
The app will switch between work-mode and break-mode back and forth, letting you balance your work and spare-time.
You can also pause if you need to run on an errand or something similar that doesn't really count as either work or break.

This is recomended for people working from home, not at your job!
